 # Mapping statistics for CapTrap-seq across different sequencing platforms in human brain and heart. 
 **(A)** Read aggregate deptools[^44] profiles along the body of annotated GENCODE genes for the CapTrap-seq combined with different long-read sequencing platforms; <br>
 **(B)** Cumulative transcript curve showing the proportion of mapped reads (Y axis) captured by the top n more expressed genes (x-axis). The pink area represents the proportion of reads captured by the top ten gene expressors; <br>
 **(C)** The GENCODE gene biotype detection for ONT and PacBio sequencing platforms. Biotype classes as described in Figure S2. The proportion of raw reads mapping to rRNA along with absolute raw read numbers in parenthesis is given on the outer side of each bar.
