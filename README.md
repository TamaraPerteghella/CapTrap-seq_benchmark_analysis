Long-read RNA sequencing is essential to produce accurate and exhaustive annotation of eukaryotic genomes. Despite advancements in throughput and accuracy, achieving reliable end-to-end identification of RNA transcripts remains a challenge for long-read sequencing methods. To address this limitation, we developed CapTrap-seq, a cDNA library preparation method, which combines the Cap-trapping strategy with oligo(dT) priming to detect 5'capped, full-length transcripts. In our study, we evaluated the performance of CapTrap-seq alongside other widely used RNA-seq library preparation protocols in human and mouse tissues, employing both ONT and PacBio sequencing technologies. To explore the quantitative capabilities of CapTrap-seq and its accuracy in reconstructing full-length RNA molecules, we implemented a novel capping strategy for synthetic RNA spike-in sequences that mimics the natural 5’cap formation. Benchmarks produced by us, as well as independent evaluations, demonstrate that CapTrap-seq is a competitive open-source, platform-agnostic RNA library preparation method for producing full-length transcript sequences.
