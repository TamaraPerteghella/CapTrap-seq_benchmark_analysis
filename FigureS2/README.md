# Mapping statistics for the human brain sample sequenced on ONT using different library preparation methods. 
**(A)** Cumulative transcript curve showing the proportion of mapped reads (Y axis) captured by the top n more expressed genes (x-axis). The pink area represents the proportion of reads captured by the top ten gene expressors; <br> 
**(B)** Detection of full-length Length distribution of mapped long-read ONT reads for each protocol (CapTrap-seq, TeloPrime® and SMARTer®) binned by length. See Figure 1E for details. (C) Support of poly(A) reads by the presence of canonical polyA polyadenylation motif[^45] within a window of +/-50 bp[^36].
