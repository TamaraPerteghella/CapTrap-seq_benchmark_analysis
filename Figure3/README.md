Full-length transcript annotation by CapTrap-seq using different long-read sequencing platforms. <br>
**(A)** Length distribution for all mapped reads and <br> **(B)** the proportion of reads with different types of termini support as described in Figure 1; <br>
**(C)** CapTrap-seq transcripts for the HMGCL gene generated using ONT, the PacBioSI and SII platforms. For details see Figure 2.
