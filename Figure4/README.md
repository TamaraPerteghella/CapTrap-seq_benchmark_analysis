# Capping of SIRVs and ERCC controls in the human brain sample using ONT. 
**(A)** Two-step enzymatic strategy for adding a cap structure at the 5â€™ ends of uncapped RNA spike-in controls; <br> 
**(B)** Detection rate of SIRV (yellow-green) and ERCC (navy) synthetic controls; <br>
**(C)** Correlation between input RNA concentration and raw read counts for ERCC spike-ins in the brain sample. Each point represents a synthetic ERCC control. The green line indicates a linear fit to the corresponding dataset; <br> 
**(D)** Detection of SIRVs as a function of length. Three main detection levels have been distinguished: end-to-end (green), partial (red), not detected/absent (gray). The black numbers displayed at the top indicate the total number of SIRVs for each detection level.
