# Benchmark of  CapTrap-seq using LRGASP samples. 
**(A)** Graphical summary of LRGASP samples and protocols selected for the CapTrap-seq benchmark; <br> 
**(B)** Length distribution for all mapped reads and <br>
**(C)** the proportion of reads with different types of termini support as described in Figure 1; the gray shades highlight the platform or the sequencing methods in case of custom sequencing approaches, e.g. R2C2. To emphasize the compatibility of CapTrap-seq with both PacBioSII and ONT samples, it was shaded in a darker gray tone. For clarity, the triple replicates for each sample were combined.
