# Capping of SIRVs and ERCC controls across tissues and platforms. 
**(A)** Experimental design for unbiased (92 ERCC spike-ins) CapTrap-seq experiments using the capped synthetic ERCC and SIRV controls; <br>
**(B)** Spearman Correlation between input RNA concentration and raw read counts for ERCC spike-ins in the brain and heart samples. The individual data points correspond to 92 synthetic ERCC RNA sequences (for further details see Figure 4); <br>
**(C)** Detection of SIRVs as a function of length. Three main detection levels have been distinguished: end-to-end (green), partial (red), not detected/absent (gray). The black numbers displayed at the top indicate the total number of SIRVs for each detection level.
