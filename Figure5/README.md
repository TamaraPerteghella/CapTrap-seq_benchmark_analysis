# Benchmark of  CapTrap-seq using LRGASP samples. 
**(A)** Proportion of ERCC spike-ins in human and mouse cell lines detected by the different LRGASP protocols and platforms <br> 
**(B)** Correlation between input RNA concentration and raw read counts for ERCC spike-ins. See Figure 4C for details. For clarity, the triple replicates for each sample have been combined.
